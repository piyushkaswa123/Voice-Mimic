# Voice Mimic - Voice Clone Generator

### Project Overview
Voice Mimic is a machine learning-based project designed to replicate a person’s voice and generate speech in that voice. It captures the unique vocal characteristics and synthesizes natural-sounding speech.

### Features
- Clone a person’s voice with high accuracy
- Generate new speech from the cloned voice
- Simple interface for inputting voice samples
- Versatile applications: voice assistants, audiobooks, and more

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/piyushkaswa123/Voice-Mimic.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Run the main file to start cloning and generating speech:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Input multiple  voice sample of 10-20 seconds for better results (recommeded 40-50).
